# 407 **Stays**
*Solving short term homelessness*

---

# The **Problem**

*According to WFME:*

> **2,258** people are experiencing homelessness, a 38% increase since 2022, and a “sobering” 75% increase since 2019, before COVID-19.

---

> Around 20% of those experience it long term. **Most** people are homeless for less than 12 months.

---

There is not a good way to address these shorter term stays outside of centralized shelters.

---

# The **Solution**

Our website creates a way to connect communities organizations with people who need housing and people who want to host.

---

# Users **Journey**

Hosts and Tenants can sign up with their specific accomdations.

These can include:
- Location
- Allergies
- Pets
- Length of Stay (1 week vs month to month)

---

# Community **Journey**
Members of the local community can sign in and view the available hosts to match to their tenants they're working with.

These can include:
- Email
- Website
- List of tenants vetted by Community

---

# Overall **Journey**

Tenants will be matched with a Community Organization for interviews and vetting.

Hosts will be contacted by Community Orgnaization to meet and match with tenants.

---

# Communication and **Discovery**

Our project facilitates this communication and discovery outside of the normal avenues like shelters or hotels.

---

# The **Impact**

If you get kicked out of your home suddenly, those first few weeks are going to be the most challanging.
